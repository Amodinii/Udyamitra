To check your eligibility, you need to provide details about your manufacturing project, such as its goals, duration, and expenses. \n\nThe information required includes:\n- Your role or type in the project (e.g., entrepreneur, investor, developer)\n- Project details, such as its name, location, and a brief description\n- Capital expenditures for your project, including costs for land acquisition, equipment, construction, etc.\n\nThe information is based on the SPECS Scheme FAQs and Guidelines.\n\n## Follow-up Questions\n1. What is your role or type in the project (e.g., entrepreneur, investor, developer)?\n2. Can you provide details about your project, such as its name, location, and a brief description?\n3.
